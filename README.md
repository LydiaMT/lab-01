# lab-01

Overview
In lab today, you will be building a single responsive web page based off of the provided design comp assets. These contain images of what you are striving to build in HTML and CSS, so be sure to open them up and keep them handy, but note that they are not for actual use on the page. You can also print out these comps and use them to mark up and sketch out page structure.

Your document must be designed in a mobile-first approach and must be responsive when the screen size changes and the page is refreshed. The details of the media query specifications are up to you, but your breakpoint must be at 768 pixels.

This is an independent project, but your are free to collaborate with your classmates.
